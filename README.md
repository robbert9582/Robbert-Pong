# Robbert Pong

**Robbert Pong** is my take on the classic arcade game, but with some funny gifs included to spice up the game.

The goal is simple: use your paddle to hit the ball back to your opponent. If the ball passes your side, your opponent scores a point. Keep your reflexes sharp and don’t let it slip past!

## Controls
- **Left Player:** `W` (up) and `S` (down)  
- **Right Player:** `↑` (up) and `↓` (down)  
- Movement is strictly vertical — no left or right movement allowed.

Let the rally begin!
